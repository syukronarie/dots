  # Offset is the extra space around each character. `offset.y` can be thought of
  # as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter spacing

  # to your convenience but make sure to adjust 'glyph_offset' appropriately post that
offset:

# Note: This requires RESTART
# By default when you change the offset above you'll see an issue, where the texts are bottom
# aligned with the cursor, this is to make sure they center align.
# This offset should usually be 1/2 of the above offset-y being set.
